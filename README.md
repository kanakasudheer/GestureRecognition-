🚀 Just tried out MediaPipe with Python
This video presents a hands on demo of real-time hand tracking and landmark detection. 💵🖐

MediaPipe (google developed) is a versatile framework that runs quickly and works well for Computer Vision on Real-world problems.

✔️ Real-time hand tracking
✔️ Pose and Facial landmark detection
Native to many platforms, for neat as hell compactness
Best for AI/ML, AR/VR and Gesture Control Apps
